StringArrayTools are great - a nice step up from your IntegerArrayTools!
You fixed all of the issues and have some really good code.

The four minimum and maximum methods are all clean and clear.

THe one that isn't clear is the printArray method.  Did you test it and see what it said?
What a mess :-)  Fix little things like that when you get a chance!

Overall, 9.5/10.  Good work.
