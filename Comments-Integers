Hi Amanda,

This is a good start but it's not finished.

You wrote getMax() and getMin() but they're not currently active.
Fine for when you're still working, but there's also no problem in
keeping them in your code and just not calling them.

Your getMaxIndex() method does not work as intended.
It instead returns the smallest item in the array,
not the location of the largest item.

And getMinIndex() is missing altogether.

Remember that you have many resources, including flash cards,
that you can use to help with writing code.  You don't have
to do it all yourself!

Your code is also missing the JavaDoc comments. 
See the instructions.

This is not complete.
It's 4/10 now; 8/10 when you finish it.

Update Feb. 1:
There is definite improvement here!  But don't take too many shortcuts,
and don't forget to test your work!

getMax and getMaxIndex and getMinIndex all work correctly now.
getMin returns the maximum, however - you need to catch that with your testing!

One style issue: getMax has a local variable MaxNum.  You want to call it maxNum

Overall, much improved.  7.5/10
